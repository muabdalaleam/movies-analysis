# Movies-analysis project :movie_camera::vhs:
## Describtion :scroll::<br>
In this project we will try to analyse the the movie making market and see the trends at it within the years.<br>
This project will awnser the questions we put in the notebook using the **[TMDB](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)** data set.<br>
The project isn't meant to be a showcase it was mainly for train my self on EDA in a very short time 4 days.<br>
so din't exepect very Wow thing and ML or prediction.<br><br>

## Project scope :mag_right::
We will use the TMbd prebuilt data set becuase our time limitation so we can't use the main TMbd API and we<br>
will try to get the more conclusions as we can and as I said <ins>This wasn't meant to be a masterpiece</ins>.<br><br>
