        <h3 id="questions">Questions I have asked:</h3><br>
        To ask those questions I have tryed my best to use data analytics <span class="colored-link">SMART</span> mehtod (Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant & Time bound)
        So they can give us more accurate & relevant answers and here are all of the project questions (even the ones those wasn't answered in this report) we will answer only here the
        first five questions:<br><br>
        <ol> 
            <li>Ratio change between Budget & Revenue each decade.
            <li>Ratio change between Budget & Revenue per each genere.
            <li>What are the most common words in movies overview per each of the top 3 popular genres. <sub>*(Just because it looks cool)</sub>
            <li>How does the revenue & the budget correlate after 21 century.
            <li>How much does the runtime of a movie correlate with it's rating.
            <li>Change of the budget and rating by years.
            <li>What are the top 10 movies in revenues before the 21 century.
            <li>Does the rating of the movie affect it's popularity.
            <li>What are the average movies ratings for the top 10 sized production companies.
            <li>
        </ol><br><br>

        <!-- ==================================Answering the questions================================== -->
            <h3 id="freelance-questions">Answering Freelance questions:</h3><br>
            
            <!--  ----------------------------------First Awnser----------------------------------- -->
                Now let's start with the <span class="colored-link">First</span> question is what is ratio change between the budget over the revenue per decades
                so we can know how is the movies market change and I found pretty <span class="colored-link">shocking</span> result and here's it:

                <div class="image-gallery">
                    <img src="../plots/budget-over-revenue-ratio-change.png" alt="people-who-earned-money-per-platform-ratio"> 
                </div><br>
                
                we can easly identify that there's a linear trend between the time and the ratio between budget and revenue, so what does this mean?
                this mans that the production companies now are <span class="colored-link">greedy & risky</span> by time so they try to maximize their
                budgets to earn more revenues they may be getting high revenues but the half of this revenues is for the budget wheres the old movies
                had the budget about only the fifth of thier revenues.<br><br>
            <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


            <!--  ----------------------------------second Awnser----------------------------------- -->
                The second question is pretty similar to the first one which was asking about ratio change between the budget over the revenue for
                each gernre which will make us understand which movie genre costs the cheapest buget compared to it's revenue:

                <div class="image-gallery">
                    <img src="../plots/budget-over-revenue-by-genre.png" alt="people-who-earned-money-by-genre-ratio"> 
                </div><br>
                
                Oh we see that the <span class="colored-link">Horror</span> movies are cheaper to produce but higher in revenues Wheres the <span class="colored-link">Science fiction</span> movies has about double budget
                to revenue ratio which mean <span class="colored-link">higher budget for less revenue</span>.<br><br>
        <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


        <!--  ----------------------------------third Awnser----------------------------------- -->
            And here's the most useless question the <span class="colored-link">third</span> one which asks 'What are the most common words in movies overview per each of the top 3 popular genres' 
            which only looks cool but it will not help us get any insight and it's good to impress anyone and here's this data gem:
    
            <div class="image-gallery">
                <img src="../plots/movies-genres-wordclouds.png" alt="people-who-earned-money-by-genre-ratio"> 
            </div><br>
                    
            Wow it looks really cool right don't regret i worked a full day for such a useless thing but still looks <span class="colored-link">COOL</span>.<br><br>
        <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


        <!--  ----------------------------------fourth Awnser----------------------------------- -->
            Now with the <span class="colored-link">fourth</span> question awnsering how does the revenue & the budget correlate after the 21 century this question will help us see
            the current trends in movies revenues and budgets and now let's look at it:
        
            <div class="image-gallery">
                <img src="../plots/revenue-and-budget-growth.png" alt="people-who-earned-money-by-genre-ratio"> 
            </div><br>

            We can spot that in the last three years the revenues are under the average but that because that the newer movies need to take more time
            to show thier real revenues anyway we can find many peacks and drops in the chart that's only because some outliers but in general we can 
            find a that it looks like a smooth bell distrbution which means that older movies had <span class="colored-link">lower revenues</span> and the ones in the middle had
            <span class="colored-link">good revenues</span> and now they have low revenues because the reason above.<br><br>
        <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


        <!--  ----------------------------------fifth Awnser----------------------------------- -->
            Finally with the <span class="colored-link">last</span> question which asks how much does the runtime of a movie correlate with it's rating
            which was origanilly asked to discover any wierd trend and unexpectedly I found a one and here's it:
        
            <div class="image-gallery">
                <img src="../plots/runtime-and-rating-corr.png" alt="people-who-earned-money-by-genre-ratio"> 
            </div><br>

            I know it needs time to understand but anyway i will explain this viz we can find that the movies longer than <span class="colored-link">120</span> mins usually gets higher
            ratings than shorter ones that's because usually when somebody knows that the movie is long he won't watch it except if he liked the movie
            from what did he hear about it before so the longer movies have higher rating just because people who saw it was <span class="colored-link">semi sure</span> that they will
            like it.<br><br>

    <!-- ===================================Conclusions & Summary================================== -->
    <h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions & Summary:</h3><br>

    after all of this mothful analysis I finally proofed many movies market hypothesises in this report or in the other dashboards and found many insights like:
    <ul>
        <li>Science fiction movies are getting <span class="colored-link">semi sure</span> and horror movies count are increasing because budget to revenue ratio are highe in the science fiction movies.
        <li>Movies in the past had higher budget to revenue ratio but they didn't this kind of crazy reveneus and anomolies like now.
        <li>Movie sucess sometimes is unpredictable so there are many outliers every where.
    </ul><br><br>
